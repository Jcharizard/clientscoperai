## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS & RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Test the optimizations**: Run `node logs/performance_test.js`
2. **Use mass mode**: Default setting for best performance
3. **Monitor health**: Check `/health` and `/ai/cache` endpoints
4. **Clear old logs**: Clean up `backend/logs/scrape_errors.log` periodically

### **Optional Enhancements:**
1. **Increase browser pool**: Change `BROWSER_POOL_SIZE` to 5 for even faster processing
2. **Add more search strategies**: Expand the search patterns array
3. **Implement request caching**: Cache Bing search results
4. **Add screenshot cleanup**: Weekly cleanup of old screenshots

### **Performance Tuning:**
```javascript
// In backend/scraper.js - for even better performance:
const BROWSER_POOL_SIZE = 5; // Increase to 5 browsers
const SCRAPE_TIMEOUT = 60000; // Increase to 60 seconds
const MAX_CONCURRENT_PROFILES = 5; // Process 5 profiles simultaneously
```
