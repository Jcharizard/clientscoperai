## üîç Technical Highlights

### Advanced Scraping Techniques

Along the various experiments and rate limit adversities along the journey of building this **(404, 429, temp IP bans), I found local scrapers get flagged and login page redirected fast.** Via a lot of testing, I discovered Instagram is a lot more lenient on letting automated cookie account scraping with mobile fingerprints, and on top Apify has actors specifically for Instagram Account scraping, with pool shuffling residential rotating proxies, it was the perfect mix to maximize highest numeral scrape results in one go, with high success rate, sustaining a 85-95% scrape success rate meanwhile minimizing rate limit, redirects, and IP Bans. Efforts to rank screenshots via vision processing AI **were** made possible with **LLM Studio**, but the ranking results ended up being too long to come back for each account, and a AI API key would be too expensive (atleast for me and a project) for so many screenshots being sent back and forth from my app to the AI. I learned how to think outside the box systematically for the first time, how to work with given boundaries and find 

Tried pool shuffling my own 1000 webshare residential proxies for each chromium pupeteer browser and each cookie, instagram caught on and quickly redirected to login pages. Had my fair fun and struggles experimenting with proxies, **learned a lot about rate limiting, basic networking protocols and how systems work.** Inevitably, the proxies **or** my methods weren't reliable enough, I had to pivot from proxies to alternatives around trying to increase my scraping limit success rate, which at the end **I ended up pivoting to Apify's API and Actor, "Instagram Profile Finder" which would scrape instagram on their own digital devices, with serverside handled rotating residential proxies to prevent as many suspicion flags/errors/redirects as possible.**
